          <p>This page informs you of any information I collect about you and any data that I store.</p>
          <p>
            The short version is: I only ever collect and store data to ensure the app runs smoothly and to provide
            functionality in the app. Never for anything else.

          <p>I am using Google Analytics to track usage data.</p>
          <p>
            This includes the number of active users on this site as well as their country of origin and operating
            system. This is mainly so I have a way to measure how many users use my app.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find out more about Google Analytics{' '}

          <Faded>TL;DR: I collect Log and Usage Data, Device Data, Location Data</Faded>
          <p>Addidtionally, I use Sentry to gather information about crashes in the app. </p>
          <p>
            This means when you experience a crash of any kind, some Log data is stored which helps me identify and fix
            the bug.
